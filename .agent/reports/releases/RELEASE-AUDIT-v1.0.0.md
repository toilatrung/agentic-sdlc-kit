# Agentic SDLC Kit v1.0.0 Release Audit

## Usage Purpose

Record the repository health audit and release-readiness decision for the Agentic SDLC Kit `v1.0.0` framework distribution.

## Record Metadata

- **Report ID**: `RELEASE-AUDIT-v1.0.0`
- **Release Version**: `v1.0.0`
- **Title**: `Agentic SDLC Kit v1.0.0 Release Audit`
- **Owner**: `release-manager`
- **Release Manager**: `release-manager`
- **Status**: `ready`
- **Target Environment**: `framework-distribution`
- **Planned Date**: `2026-06-22`
- **Actual Date**: `pending`

## Release Scope

- **Included Epics or Tasks**: `framework packaging phase`
- **Included Commits**: `none; repository is not connected to an accessible Git worktree`
- **Included Artifacts**: `operating policy, planning and execution registries, governance and report model, 12 templates, 8 prompts, validator, packaging documents, and v1.0.0 release notes`
- **Excluded or Deferred Items**: `application source, project tests, deployment infrastructure, and unresolved onboarded-project inputs`

## Related Files

- **Implementation Reports**: `this packaging session is evidenced by the changed framework artifacts and validator output`
- **Review Reports**: `this release audit`
- **QA Reports**: `validator result: FRAMEWORK_VALIDATION_PASS`
- **Change Requests**: `none; core operating policy and lifecycle definitions were not changed`
- **Decisions**: `MIT license selected for distribution packaging`
- **Risks and Known Issues**: `BLOCKER-001, BLOCKER-002, and BLOCKER-003 concern absent onboarded-project inputs and do not indicate framework defects`

## Readiness Checks

- [x] Required packaging files exist: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- [x] All Markdown documents have complete frontmatter and unique IDs.
- [x] All 12 required templates exist under `.agent/templates/` and pass heading checks.
- [x] All 8 required prompts exist and define role, responsibilities, inputs, allowed actions, forbidden actions, outputs, and validation.
- [x] Epic and task lifecycle enums match operating policy, templates, and registries.
- [x] Runtime governance and report folders contain no reusable templates.
- [x] Internal Markdown links resolve.
- [x] Dependency graph contains no self-reference or directed cycle.
- [x] `scripts/validate-framework.py` executed successfully and printed `FRAMEWORK_VALIDATION_PASS`.

## Audit Findings

| Finding ID | Severity | Result | Evidence | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AUDIT-001` | `observation` | The default `python.exe` Windows Store alias could not start in the audit environment. | Direct Python 3.12 interpreter executed the validator successfully. | Document Python 3.10+ and invoke an installed interpreter in CI. |
| `AUDIT-002` | `observation` | Three open blockers track missing SRS, contract, and architecture inputs from an incomplete downstream project onboarding attempt. | `.agent/governance/blockers/BLOCKER-001.md` through `BLOCKER-003.md` | Non-blocking for framework release; they accurately preserve runtime onboarding state. |

No critical, major, or minor framework findings remain open.

## Deployment Plan

- **Procedure Path**: `Publish the repository at tag v1.0.0 after creating a Git worktree and verifying the release commit.`
- **Responsible Owner**: `release-manager`
- **Start Criteria**: `FRAMEWORK_VALIDATION_PASS and approved publication authority`
- **Success Criteria**: `v1.0.0 tag and distributable repository contain the audited artifact set`
- **Monitoring Window**: `first consumer bootstrap and onboarding validation`

## Rollback Plan

- **Trigger Criteria**: `published artifact differs from the audited files or validation fails after publication`
- **Procedure Path**: `Withdraw the affected artifact, restore the last validated release, correct through governed change, and publish a superseding version.`
- **Responsible Owner**: `release-manager`
- **Recovery Verification**: `run scripts/validate-framework.py and compare release contents with this audit scope`

## Deployment Outcome

- **Outcome**: `pending`
- **Evidence**: `local framework validation passed; publication has not been performed`
- **Incidents or Regressions**: `none`
- **Post-Release Verification**: `pending publication`

## Completion Criteria

- [x] Packaging, prompt, validation, and release-note assets are present.
- [x] Repository health audit completed without release-blocking findings.
- [x] Framework validation passed.
- [x] Core operating rules and lifecycle definitions remain unchanged.
- [ ] Publication commit and `v1.0.0` tag are created by an authorized release owner.

## Forbidden Actions

- Do not mark the release `deployed` before publication and post-release verification.
- Do not suppress downstream onboarding blockers or represent them as resolved.
- Do not change audited scope, operating policy, or lifecycle definitions without governed authorization.
- Do not claim Git commit or tag evidence that does not exist.

## Output Requirements

- Preserve this audit at `.agent/reports/releases/RELEASE-AUDIT-v1.0.0.md`.
- Re-run `scripts/validate-framework.py` on the publication commit.
- Release readiness status: `READY_FOR_V1_RELEASE`.
